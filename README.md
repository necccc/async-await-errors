# async-await-errors
Small examples on handling errors with async/await functions in some popular Node.js web frameworks


## Usage

Clone the repo, then run `npm install`.

The examples here can be ran by picking the framework you wish

```
npm run express

npm run hapi
```

Any of these will start a server listening on port 3000, and they are using `nodemon` so you can edit code, and play with results.
